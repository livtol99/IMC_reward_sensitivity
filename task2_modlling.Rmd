## 2. Multilevel modelling of reward anticipation and self reports of pleasure and experience of reward
Q: Does lab-measured reward anticipation (averaged EEfRT scores) predict self-reported (i) "anticipated reward pleasure" (ii) "experienced reward" in the real world (ESM)? 


	- Use the averaged EEfRT scores created in task 1. (Scores from the 2 days(pos and neg) merged together, but with 3 levels, low, med, high probability)
	
	- Use multilevel modelling, with 3 levels of nested data (questionnaires, nested within days, within participants)
	
	- The analysis would be very close to the paper: https://psyarxiv.com/fnhd9/, but with EEfRT performance as the participant-level predictors (low, med, high) instead of the ISI, RPA scores, and ERQ scores. The EEfRT are obviously not day-level predictors, but more like our covariates baseline, ISI  - instead of baseline participant-level ISI scores, RPA scores, and ERQ scores). "Participant" and "Days within participant" are random intercepts.

#Rename Actual_ID in ESM df to ID

#Creating a merged column of subject and day
ESM$subj_day <- paste(ESM$ID, ESM$Day)

#Merging the two dfs

## Actual modelling

Variable types:
- Outcome/dependent variables (ant/con. pleasure) are ordinal (measured on 7 pt. Likert scale)
- Predictors: EEfRT averages are ratios. Between 0 and 1


I should consider centering the outcome variables (ant/con pleasure - see link: https://philippmasur.de/2018/05/23/how-to-center-in-multilevel-models/)

Christine writes that the multilevel analysis should contain:
- checking residuals
- mean-centring some variables
- running models (with and without outliers)
- generating some plots at the end

```{r}
#Inspecting range of EEfRT ratios (predictors)
min(ESM_merged$EEfRT_averaged_lowp) #0
max(ESM_merged$EEfRT_averaged_lowp) #0.81

min(ESM_merged$EEfRT_averaged_medp) #0
max(ESM_merged$EEfRT_averaged_medp) #0.975

min(ESM_merged$EEfRT_averaged_highp) #0.03
max(ESM_merged$EEfRT_averaged_highp) #0.1


#Consider centering the outcome variable
```




```{r}
ESM %>%
    group_by(Actual_ID) %>%
    summarise(count=n())
